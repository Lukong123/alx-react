## TASKS
### 0. Read Data from Json
Reuse the latest dashboard project you worked on in the React course 0x06-React_state

For this task, place notifications.json into the root of the project directory and use the data inside for the next step.

Create a new notifications.js file in a schema folder:

Import the JSON data from notifications.json and give it a name. Try import * as [variable name] from [path to notifications.json]
Create a function named getAllNotificationsByUser that accepts userId as an argument
The function should return a list containing all the context objects from the notifications.json data when the author id is the same as the userId
In the same schema directory, create a notifications.test.js file:

Add a test that uses the id 5debd764a7c57c7839d722e9 and verifies that the following data is returned:
[
  {
    guid: "2d8e40be-1c78-4de0-afc9-fcc147afd4d2",
    isRead: true,
    type: "urgent",
    value:
      "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt."
  },
  {
    guid: "280913fe-38dd-4abd-8ab6-acdb4105f922",
    isRead: false,
    type: "urgent",
    value:
      "Non diam phasellus vestibulum lorem sed risus ultricies. Tellus mauris a diam maecenas sed"
  }
]
Tips:

You can easily import JSON data using Babel
When writing your test, you can use the arrayContaining method from Jest to easily compare what the function returns and what you are expecting
Requirements:

You can use any loop function to go through the array
All the tests in the project should pass

### 1. Normalize Nested JSON
Copy over dashboard from the previous task into a task_1 directory at the root of the project

Modify src/schema/notifications.js to set up a schema using Normalizr

You’re going to use schema.Entity to create a 3 of entities.

The first one is an example the task will provide for you.

const user = new schema.Entity("users")

Create a message entity in a variable called message whose key is messages and set the idAttribute to the string guid in the options
Create a notification entity in a variable called notification whose key is notifications and set the definition of the entity as so:
author: user
context: message
Add a test in schema/notifications.test.js to verify that your normalized data has a correct result array. It should contain:

  "5debd76480edafc8af244228"
  "5debd764507712e7a1307303"
  "5debd76444dd4dafea89d53b"
  "5debd76485ee4dfd1284f97b"
  "5debd7644e561e022d66e61a"
  "5debd7644aaed86c97bf9d5e"
  "5debd76413f0d5e5429c28a0"
  "5debd7642e815cd350407777"
  "5debd764c1127bc5a490a4d0"
  "5debd7646ef31e0861ec1cab"
  "5debd764a4f11eabef05a81d"
  "5debd764af0fdd1fc815ad9b"
  "5debd76468cb5b277fd125f4"
  "5debd764de9fa684468cdc0b"
Add a test to verify that your normalized data has a correct users entity. Test to access the user with the id 5debd764a7c57c7839d722e9. It should return:

      age: 25,
      email: "poole.sanders@holberton.nz",
      id: "5debd764a7c57c7839d722e9",
      name: { first: "Poole", last: "Sanders" },
      picture: "http://placehold.it/32x32"
Add a test to verify that your normalized data has a correct messages entity. Test to access the message with the guid efb6c485-00f7-4fdf-97cc-5e12d14d6c41. It should return:

      guid: "efb6c485-00f7-4fdf-97cc-5e12d14d6c41",
      isRead: false,
      type: "default",
      value: "Cursus risus at ultrices mi."
Add a test to verify that your normalized data has a correct notifications entity. Test to access the notification with the id 5debd7642e815cd350407777. It should return:

      author: "5debd764f8452ef92346c772",
      context: "3068c575-d619-40af-bf12-dece1ee18dd3",
      id: "5debd7642e815cd350407777"
Tips:

The expected goal is to obtain a very easy to use dataset
If you are having undefined issues, look at idAttribute from the Normalizr documentation
Requirements:

You must export the list of notifications using a Normalizr’s normalize
All the tests in the project should pass
### 2. Filter a Normalizr schema
Copy the contents of dashboard from the task_1 directory into a task_2 directory at the root of the project

Modify the function getAllNotificationsByUser to use the normalized dataset

Requirements:

You should only use one loop at this point
You should not use Object.keys
You should not have to modify the test, and the test should pass correctly
All the tests in the project should pass
