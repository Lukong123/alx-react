## TASKS
### 0. Inline styling
Copy over the task_5 directory from the 0x04. React components project (Weâ€™ll be using it as the base for this project)
Rename the task_5 directory to task_0
Modify the CourseListRow component in task_0/dashboard/src/CourseList/CourseListRow.js:

Using inline styling, change the background color of a row to #f5f5f5ab
Using inline styling, change the background color of a header row to #deb5b545
If needed, modify the test file so every test pass
Tips:

For better performances, never create and pass an object to an element directly. Use a constant instead
Use the isHeader prop to easily pick the style you want to apply to the tr tag
Requirement:

Even if the modification is small, make sure that your test suites are still passing. Especially the file CourseListRow.test.js

Tips:

Look into using StyleSheetTestUtils.suppressStyleInjection at the top of your test file, to prevent issues with style injections

At this point, the UI should look exactly the same with the inline styling as it was with the CSS files
